decision tree is the algorithm which allows us to not code nested if else again again then it automatically do it 

if we seee geometrically it cut the coordinate system according to some conditions and we got the decision tree in which we find best planes and then divide the coordinate plane 

so we use concept of entropy and ginni formula!! 

mathematics

entropy is just disorderness of the dataset 

conclusion of dataset is that 
data have more knowledge then entropy less 
if less knowledge then entropy more 


so from dataset we find weighted entropy of it 
then information gain of each if info gain is more then divide it on that 
split it then again on that again entropy of at then if 0 it become leaf then if not zero then weighted entropy then info gain of all if then info then to it untill features=0  or then entropy=0 or info gain =0

get the best decision tree 

entropy=-plogp

ginni formula 

g=1+(p-p)
